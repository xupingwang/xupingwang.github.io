title: Project Benson MTA Turnstile Data Analysis
---

This is the my first week at [Metis](http://thisismetis.com) as a data science student. In the first project, my teammates and I take on the role of data scientists, to help our client, a fictional organization WTWY, to figure out the time and subway stations to place their volunteers, and collect as many signature as possible in front of the subway station.

## Data and Method

Due to the short amount of time given for the first project, we decided to work mostly on [MTA turnstile data](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html). We look for top stations in terms of entries count, and find out the day of week that has the most ridership. We belive the sheer size passenger flow will help the street team achieve their goal.

## Result
